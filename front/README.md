<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
1. React: The tool's frontend is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

2. Chart.js: Chart.js is used for creating visual representations of data, such as the chart showing time taken by each algorithm.

3. Node.js: Node.js is utilized to run the backend server, which handles URL scraping and data analysis.

4. Express.js: Express.js is used to create the backend API for serving the frontend and handling data requests.

5. Python (Flask): Python is used for the web scraping and keyword analysis tasks. Flask, a Python web framework, is employed to create the backend for these functionalities.
